Thoughts
--------
Enjoyed learning data structures. It allowed me to access dynamic programming and understand concepts that are used within everyday life. For example, when learning about node structures, I made a connection on how visisted notes are practically "checkpoints"; all in all, great concepts to learn within this class.
